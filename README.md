# Eiffel-Visualization

## First setup
First start the application consulting the [README](https://github.com/olale/Eiffel-Visualization/blob/master/App/README.md) file in the App folder to start the Mongo database.
Then import the data and generate graphs consulting the [README](https://github.com/olale/Eiffel-Visualization/blob/master/Data/README.md) in the Data folder.


When the data is imported you should be good to go so just navigate to 127.0.0.1:3000
